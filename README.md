# DHCP Lease Viewer

My DHCP was running on an AP cause I had a ton of settings on it I didn't want to migrate. It started failing and I was tired of my solution being a timed reset so I moved my DHCP and DNS to my homelab.
This is a tool so I can see leases, it also lets you check for a few ports.
